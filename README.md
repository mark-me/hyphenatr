`hyphenatr` : HY-PHEN-ATE ALL THE THINGS

Based on the [Hunspell hyphenation
library](https://github.com/hunspell/hyphen) and includes hyphenation
rules dictionaries from
[LibreOffice](https://github.com/LibreOffice/dictionaries). See the
<inst/COPYRIGHTS> file for individual copyright information.

The following functions are implemented:

  - `curr_dict`: Identify current hyphen rules language
  - `hyphenate`: Hyphenate a character vector of words
  - `list_dicts`: List available hyphenation languages rules
  - `switch_dict`: Switch hyphen rules language

### Special thanks to

  - @daroczig & @edwindj for language testing.

### Installation

``` r
devtools::install_github("hrbrmstr/hyphenatr")
```

### Usage

``` r
library(hyphenatr)
library(jsonlite)
library(microbenchmark)
