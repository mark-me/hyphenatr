\title{Tools to Hyphenate Strings Using the 'Hunspell' Hyphenation Library}
\description{
Identifying hyphenation points in strings can be useful for both
text processing and display functions. The 'Hunspell' hyphenation library
provides tools to perform hyphenation using custom language rule dictionaries.
Words can be hyphenated directly or split into hyphenated component strings
for further processing.
}
\details{
Based on the \href{https://github.com/hunspell/hyphen}{Hunspell hyphenation library}
and includes hyphenation rules dictionaries from
\href{https://github.com/LibreOffice/dictionaries}{LibreOffice}.

Special thanks to Edwin de Jonge & Gergely Dar√≥czi for language testing.
}
\note{
The \code{en_US} hyphenation rules dictionary is loaded by default
